# Project 2 - Wordle

Submitted by: Priyanka Bose

Wordle is an app that allows users to guess words. Words are randomly generated and users can try to guess the alphabets. If the alphabet is present in the word, it's highligted in yellow. If it is present in the word, at the correct position, it gets highligted in green.
Users are also allowed to change settings on number of letters allowed, number of guesses allowed as well as if they want an alien word every time. They can also choose a theme for the word to be guessed.

Time spent: 8 hours spent in total

## Notes

No challenges as such, Optionals were an easy concept to grasp. I remember from class how its used in Networking concepts mostly, but would still like to practice more to understand its usage.
Also, I did my first ever Loom embedding on Git. Contrary to what I was thinking, it was actually quite easy!
